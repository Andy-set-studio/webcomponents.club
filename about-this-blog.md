Hey there! Welcome.

I've put together this little blog to document my learning about [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). This is mainly a blog for me personally, but hopefully, it'll help others that are learning about web components too.

It'll be a bit rough around the edges and loose, but that's cool because I keep my more polished work on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/andybell/) and [Medium ﻿](https://medium.com/@hankchizljaw). It'll be nice to run a casual journal for a change of pace.

### About me

My name's [Andy](https://hankchizljaw.io) and I started designing and building websites as a hobby in 2006 with a trusty copy of ‘Dreamweaver 8 Design and Construction’. My interest levels really peaked when I discovered that you could modify the look and feel of your MySpace page and build free GeoCities sites.

In my years of working in this industry, I have been lucky enough to work with great brands such as Harley-Davidson®, Sky, British Cycling, the NHS and Oracle. Working with these organisations has allowed me to work on exciting and challenging projects at scale.

### Reach out

Got any comments or queries about this sort of stuff? You can [drop me an email](mailto:andy@hankchizljaw.io), or shoot over to [devpal.io](https://devpal.io) where I try to help front-end developers who need help with their code or need advice about the industry. You can also catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw), where my DMs are always open.
