As the [about page](/about-this-blog) suggests, I'm going to write as I learn web components on this little blog here. As of today, I don't really know much, but I'm definitely excited.

I see web components as a major opportunity for the web platform as a whole. Yes, there's JavaScript frameworks, which themselves are doing a fantastic job of progressing the platform, but baked in capability to build rich applications seems like a winner to me.

### My initial feelings

I've been thinking about web components for a while now. I appreciate how [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000) keeps them in conversation in [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com) episodes and really felt for him when the [HTML imports](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/279-rip-html-imports/) dream disappeared. With that, my interest also fell off because I thought "what's the point" when Vue seemed to be doing a good job with single file components.

This has all changed though. At Google I/O, [Monica Dinculescu](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf) gave a really interesting talk, which I think you should watch because it's certainly really inspired me.

In the talk, a [PWA starter kit](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit) and some very useful [PWA helpers](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit) were announced and demonstrated. I'm a really big fan of the [~25 line router](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-helpers/blob/master/router.js) especially.

I constantly try to reduce weight in what I produce on the web, so this approach really appeals to me. The only thing I'm really not feeling right now is [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) for templating. I'm willing to give it a fair crack though.

I'll kick off my learning with those repositories. Maybe I'll make something really simple to just get a feel of things. I'll write about it here for sure.
